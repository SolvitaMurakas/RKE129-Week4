                Jigglypuff is a pink with spherical body dual-type Normal/Fairy Pokémon introduced in Generation I. It evolves from Igglybuff when leveled up with high friendship and evolves into Wigglytuff when exposed to a Moon Stone.

            <p class="Text-Right">
                Jigglypuff can use its eyes to mesmerize opponents. It has a large lung capacity, exceeding most other Pokémon. Once it has an opponent's attention, Jigglypuff will inflate its lungs and begin to sing a soothing and mysterious lullaby.
